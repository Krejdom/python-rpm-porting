The section for applications is for software where the user doesn't care in which programming language it is written. For example, it doesn't matter if it is written in Python 2 or 3 because the application should run the same.

If your package is not being imported by third-party projects (e.g. ``import some_module`` in a Python file), it is most likely an application.
